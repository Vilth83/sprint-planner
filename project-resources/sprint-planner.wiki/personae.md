Here are to be found the 5 created personae.
Each one was inspired from a real coworker, having goals and frustrations.

Their expectations will help us provide user stories and answer the need of the team as close as we can be.

## Context
All the team work on an application for intern use.
The organization is agile@scale with the following iterations:
-  10 week product Incrementation containing 5 sprints.
- 2 week sprints.
- features are released each week (2 releases in 1 sprint).

Releases are done with CI/CD tools (Jenkins, XLdeploy) with human control at each step.
Some developers of the team are assigned the release (the assignation is done without coordination, often in the urge).

As the application has just been released in production, particular attention is given to support.
Support is done on follow-the-sun, with 3 teams : Paris, Bangalore, Montreal.

A support leader is designated for the day for each teams.
Designated support can be a developer or a business analyst.
As for the releaser of the week, the support leader designation is done without coordination, and often decided at the very moment an issue occurs.
