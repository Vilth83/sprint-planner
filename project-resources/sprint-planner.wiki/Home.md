## main idea
Sprint planner is a support tool made for developers, team leaders and agile masters.

Its main fuctionality is to help organizing releases by selecting a releaser in the team for each release : a mail information is sent to the selected releaser and to the team, to inform everyone.

The release version number is incremented automatically following project iteration pattern, so that the given releaser don't have to investigate to have the right version number.

Sprint planner also provides a support team leader selection functionality : as for releaser, information is given by mail.
