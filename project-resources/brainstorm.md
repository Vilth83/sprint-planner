## Idea

Many teams are agile, and agility requires a good self organization.
Unfortunately, every developer has his own feature to develop, often in the urge, and agility can become hard to maintain.
Sprint-planner intends to help keep calm and be agile by taking care of sprint management and by organizing automatically
releasers and support designation.

See below the main functionalities
